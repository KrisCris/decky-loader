# A fork of Decky Loader that implemented proxy support

You can find the recent builds [here](https://github.com/KrisCris/decky-loader/actions/workflows/build.yml).

Check out the code (or the issue linked below) for usage. There will be no support for using proxies for any purpose.

I expect most of you know why you are here and what you are doing.

Finally, enjoy tweaking around the Steam Deck, with unblocked network and the never-stuck Decky Loader.

## To answer [the question by TrainDoctor](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader/issues/266)

### Question

> I'm not sure why you're forked and not contributed upstream. Proxies are highly insecure compared to other forms thus our lack of support.

### Answer

- Because you guys have no plan to support proxies, and I have no plan for making it available to ppl who don't really need it.
- This is primarily made to be used with [mihomo (aka. Clash Meta)](https://github.com/MetaCubeX/mihomo/tree/Meta) or similar traffic encryption & obfuscation tool that runs locally, for circumventing the thing that shall not be publically named (just kidding, fuck GFW).
